# teaching myself Ansible

As a tiny autodidact project I hooked up a cluster of three old Asus Eee PCs for experiments with
ansible and kubernetes (and potentially Hadoop and HBase later). In my tradition to name computers after StarTrek
characters the computers all carry names of medical officers: bashir, crusher and mccoy. All have 2GB Ram - the
maximum capacity for the Eee PC - so that probably limits the setup to educational purposes.

Consequently McCoy is also the oldest of the netbooks running an Intel Atom N270 processor with no x86_64
instruction set so some packages cannot be obtained precompiled but need to build for it.

Bashir, being the youngest, can be burdened with the additional task of serving a common home directory for the
cluster (via NFS).
